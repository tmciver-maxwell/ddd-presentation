* DDD: What Is It?

** Domain-Driven Design
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Emphasizes the domain model as the central piece of an application
- Emphasizes direct collaboration between developers and domain experts
- Results in a "Ubiquitous Language" that is used to communicate domain concepts

* Building Blocks

** 4 Basic Types
- Entities
- Value Objects
- Repositories
- Services

** Entities
are domain objects whose identity is NOT defined by their attributes
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Consider two people with the same name; they are not the same entity!
- Some entities will have natural identifiers. E.g., SSN.
- If there is no natural identifier, one must be generated for it at creation time.

** Value Objects
are objects that ARE defined by their attributes
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Need no separate identifier
- Should be immutable

** Example
#+BEGIN_SRC php
// Entity
class User {
  private $id; // could have used SSN, if it was available
  private $name;
  private $address;

  public function changeName($newName) { $this->name = $newName; }
  public function changeAddress($newAddress) { $this->address = $newAddress; }
}

// Value Object
class Name {
  private $firstName;
  private $lastName;
}

// Value Object
class Address {
  private $street;
  private $city;
  private $state;
  private $zip
}

** Repositories
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- are objects used to retrieve entities from and persist entities to storage.
- Recommend creating an interface or trait so that different implementatinos can be provided (this is the Strategy Pattern: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)

** Example Repository
#+BEGIN_SRC php
interface Repository {
  function getById($id);
  function save($entity);
}

class MySqlRepository implements Repository {

  function getById($id) { /* query real MySQL database */ }
  function save($entity) { /* insert data into real MySQL database */ }
}

class InMemoryRepository implements Repository {
  private $db; // array of id to entity

  function getById($id) { /* query $db */ }
  function save($entity) { /* mutate $db */ }
}
#+END_SRC

** Services
are objects that
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- orchestrate coordination of complex domain logic
- ideally will allow clients to perform this complex action with a single method call

** Example Service
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
class OpenEnrollment(oeRepo: Repository[OpenEnrollment],
                     titanClient: TitanClient) {
  def edit(oeId: UUID, startDate: Instant, endDate: Instant): Future[Unit] = {
    for { // In Future
      // get the OE domain object
      oe <- oeRepo.getById(oeID)

      // edit the OE
      editedOe <- editOpenEnrollent(oe)

      // save it
      _ <- oeRepo.save(editedOe)

      // conditionally "run" it
      _ <- if (editedOe.status === OpenEnrollmentState.Ready) {
             runOpenEnrollment(editedOe)
           } else {
             Future.successful(())
	   }
    }
  }

  def runOpenEnrollment(oe: OpenEnrollment): Future[Unit] = { ... }
}
#+END_SRC
