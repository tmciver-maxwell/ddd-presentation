* DDD: What Is It?

** Domain-Driven Design
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Emphasizes the domain model as the central piece of an application
- Emphasizes direct collaboration between developers and domain experts
- Results in a "Ubiquitous Language" that is used to communicate domain concepts

* Building Blocks

** Domain Objects
- Entities
- Value Objects

** Entities
Are objects that
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Have some kind of identity
- Are not defined by their attributes
- Need to have changes tracked

** Entities
An example might be a User object.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Cannot use attributes such as name and address to identify as these can change over time.
- SSN could be used as an ID, if there is one.
- For entities that have no natural identifier, one can be generated at creation time.

** Value Objects
Are objects that
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Are defined by their attributes
- Objects that have no identity but are defined by their values (e.g., Name, Date, Address)
